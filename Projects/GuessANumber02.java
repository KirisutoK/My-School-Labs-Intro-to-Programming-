 * One of the quintessential programming exercises for aspiring software
 * engineers is the classic game, Guess A Number. The game secretly selects a
 * number and affords the user a chance to keep guessing a number. The game ends
 * when the user guesses the secret number.
 * 
 * Our version of the game will inform the user if their guess was too high or
 * too low, helping the user to hone in on the actual number.
