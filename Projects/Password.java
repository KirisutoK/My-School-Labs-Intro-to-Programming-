/**
 * Password Project
 * STEP 1: Display a menu of options

    The menu of options (see the Sample Output for details) should provide three options:

    Choice1:
    Show the password specifications

    Choice2: Generate a random password
    The first two characters are lowercase letters
    The second two characters are uppercase letters
    The third two characters are numbers (0 - 9)
    The fourth two characters are any valid character

    Choice3: Valid or Invalid
    It must be at least 8 characters long
    At least one letter must be capitalized
    It must contain at least 2 numbers

    STEP 2: Run the appropriate code based on the input from the user

    if statements will be used to decide which method will be called.

         * First Phase: 
         *  User input is gathered.
         * 
         * Second Phase:
         *  It analayzes and defines the length of the string which is Verification1.
         * 
         * Third Phase:
         *  The string is checked by each single char using CharAt(location) to locate each Char inside a 
         *  string while using the While statement and add location++ until its greater than the length of
         *  the input. 
         *  
         *  by locating each char in a string. the char is then concaneted into an int which can be defined as ASCII.
         *  
         *  ASCII Uppercase (65-90)
         *  ASCII Numbers (48-57)
         *  
         *  If the int is in one of those range, it will add a point to a variable.
         *  
         *  UppercasePoints
         *  NumberPoints
         *  
         *  If UppercasePoints is greater than 0 then it passess the verification.
         *  if Numberpoitns if greater or equal to 2 then it passes the verification.
         *  
         * Fourth Phase:
         *  Each 3 specifications are gathered and if all 3 specifications are true, then it will return as Valid.
         *  if 1 of the specifications are wrong, then its NOT valid.

// =============== LAB SUMMARY ===============

/*
 * 1. What was the hardest part of this lab?
 * Step 3 is the hardest part. I totally had no idea what is valid and invalid.
 * 
 * I had a hard time figuring out the last 2 characters for Choice 2. i did not
 * know what was the right range in order to get the desired output.
 * After testing and trying out different ranges. i found out that all the
 * typeable characters are 33-126 rather than 32-126. i did not know that
 * space was not included in it.
 * 
 * For Choice 2. i had a hard time making the program to define each char in a string. I was planning to use substring but then i found out charAt() was better.
 * I used charAt() to locate each char in a string and turned thos char into decimals. then used the decimals to make an if statements base on ASCII Table.
 * 
 * the other difficult part that i had was that my code was so hard to read. often forgeting how to use most of what i learned like global variables and 
 * local variables. I had put some data types in every single if statements block making it local.
 * 
 * 
 * 2. What will you always remember (never forget) from this exercise?
 *  I learned how to do While statements trying to define each single char inside a string.
 *  While is a loop statement where it is triggered until it meets what it desires while if statement is only triggered only once.
 * 
 * I will never forget that in order to make a variable into a global variable its data type must be defined and remove its data type in local blocks of code.
